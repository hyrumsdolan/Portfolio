## Portfolio

# Description
This is a simple website using some techniques learned through the first two weeks of Bootcamp, in addition to some extra things I wanted to try. The site showcases my projects I've worked on, and is easy to add extra projects in while still being responsive. There is also a small dumb easter egg thrown in with a pseduo element.

# Snapshot of Website
The sidebar header does funtion properly on the website, but looks awkward in on the picture.
